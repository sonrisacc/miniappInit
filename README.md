# waterFall

We are going to represent a series of walls of different integer heights.

// given an input arr(which holds n element)
// iterate through arr
// at each cur position
// find the left max wall, and right max wall
// take the min wall, compare with the cur number
// cur > min, no water
// cur < min, add this drop of water to result

// time complexity: linear, since we are iterate through every element
